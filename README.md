## How it works:

Download all the files from the repositories
that are enabled in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d
and save them in a new / packages folder

## Instructions:

Comment those repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d that we do not want to download.

Run as root:

chmod 755 downallapt
mv downallapt /usr/local/bin/downallapt
downallapt
